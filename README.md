Applied Data Analysis Portfolio

Kika Okwubuasi-Andrew
MSc Cognitive Neuroimaging | Behavioural & Applied Data Analysis

Overview

This repository presents applied data analysis projects completed during my MSc in Cognitive Neuroimaging and psychology-focused research training.

My work centres on:

Behavioural and psychological data analysis

Applied Python workflows

Translating complex findings into clear, non-technical insights

Research-driven decision making

The emphasis is on practical analytical skills rather than purely theoretical coursework.

Technical Skills

Programming & Tools
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

Data Analysis
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Trend and distribution analysis

Statistics & Research
Descriptive statistics
Basic inferential testing
Hypothesis formulation and interpretation

Communication
Clear written reporting for non-technical audiences


Project 1: Academic Pressure & Student Mental Health

Data Science for Brain & Behaviour – MSc Module

Aim
To examine relationships between academic pressure, perceived stress, and student wellbeing using survey-based behavioural data.

Approach

Cleaned and structured raw survey datasets using Python

Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify trends, distributions, and outliers

Examined relationships between workload, stress indicators, and wellbeing measures

Applied basic statistical techniques to explore predictors of perceived stress

Produced clear visualisations to support interpretation

Communicated findings in a structured written report

Key Findings

Identified academic factors most strongly associated with elevated stress

Found that perceived workload may be more influential than objective workload measures

Demonstrated how behavioural data can inform wellbeing-focused interventions

Skills Demonstrated
Behavioural data analysis
Statistical reasoning in a psychological context
Insight translation and reporting


Project 2: Retail Rationalisation & Store Closure Patterns

Independent Applied Analysis

Aim
To investigate whether large-scale retail store closures followed identifiable economic and geographic patterns rather than occurring randomly.

Approach

Merged regional and temporal datasets into a unified analysis framework

Analysed closure trends across time and location

Examined clustering and distribution patterns

Created visual summaries to support interpretation

Presented findings through a clear analytical narrative

Key Findings

Store closures followed systematic patterns rather than random distribution

Specific regions and time periods were disproportionately affected

Results suggested strategic rationalisation aligned with broader economic pressures

Skills Demonstrated
Dataset merging and transformation
Trend and pattern analysis
Insight-driven storytelling with data


Project 3: MSc Dissertation (In Progress)

Sensorimotor Synchronisation in an Augmented Reality Music Ensemble

Overview
This dissertation investigates how humans synchronise movement with external rhythmic agents in augmented reality environments.

Participants perform tapping tasks while interacting with a virtual ensemble that:

Follows their timing

Lags behind

Ignores their timing

Methods
Behavioural tapping experiments
Subjective experience ratings
Computational modelling of timing accuracy and synchronisation error

Techniques & Focus
Behavioural data preprocessing
Timing error and synchronisation analysis
Statistical comparison across experimental conditions
Research design and ethical approval (ERN_09-528)

Research Themes
Human–machine interaction
Predictive timing and adaptation
Applied cognitive neuroscience in immersive systems

Final analyses and results will be added upon project completion.

Purpose

This portfolio complements my CV by providing concrete evidence of applied data and research skills, bridging academic training and real-world analysis.

It is intended for:

Graduate and entry-level data analyst roles

Behavioural and UX research positions

Research assistant and applied science roles
